# Content-based-Music-Recommendation System using Deep Learning
3rd year university project seeking to bridge the semantic gap between music audio and user preferences

## Abstract
The automated curation of music playlists has become a signifcant problem in the last decade, with the colossal rise of streaming platforms e.g. Spotify.

Current state-of-the-art recommender systems depend on the **collaborative filtering** model. 
Nevertheless, these systems experience the **cold start problem**; 
they break down when no historical
data is available and as a result they cannot recommend new and unpopular songs.


In this paper, the author proposes a new recommendation model that uses music
audio and deep learning to produce playlists based on a given query song. 

## Datasets

## Results
The system was evaluated qualitatively using a human evaluation study on the free music
archive dataset. The results show that the model produces recommendations of a
sensible nature. To conclude, the project shows that use of deep learning in a music
recommendation setting has the potential to outperform traditional content-agnostic approaches.
